These tests will check how well your GeoCoord type can handle increasingly large amounts of data
data1 - around 100 random names
data2 - around 1000 random names
data3 - around 10000 random names
queries1 - create a hash index and observe what method is used to find rows (sometimes PostgreSQL will pick a different searching method)
queries2 - run some complex queries on the table
