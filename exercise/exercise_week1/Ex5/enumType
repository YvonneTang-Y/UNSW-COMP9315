What is the effect in the catalog of

create type Mood as enum ('sad', 'happy');

Result:
- adds a tuple for the type itself in the pg_type table
- adds two tuples in the pg_enum table, one for each value

Running examples:

=# select oid, typname, typlen, typtype from pg_type where typname='mood';


=# select oid, * from pg_enum where enumtypid=16605;


Note that names are mapped to all lower-case in the PostgreSQL catalog.
Using typname='Mood' in the first query will produce no results.
