Consider a table R(x,y,z) using multi-attribute hashing where

d = 9    d[x] = 5    d[y] = 3    d[z] = 1

How many buckets are accessed in answering each of these queries?

select * from R where x = 4 and y = 2 and z = 1

  all bits known => 1 bucket

select * from R where x = 5 and y = 3

  ? unknown bits => ? buckets

select * from R where y = 99

  ? unknown bits => ? buckets

select * from R where z = 23

  ? unknown bits => ? buckets

select * from R where x > 5

  linear scan; hashing no help with Range queries
