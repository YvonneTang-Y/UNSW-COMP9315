Describe path(s) through the tree in solving
each of the following:


Query: (m,1)

at level 1, (m,1) fits only in (a0,m4)
at level 2, (m,1) fits only in (g0,m2)
leads to data page, which contains (m,1)


Query: (a,?)

at level 1, (a,?) fits in (a0,m4) and (a5,m9)
(a0,m4) -> (a,?) fits in (a0,f2) and (a3,f4)
(a0,f2) -> (a,?) fits in (a0,c1) and (a2,c2)
(a0,c1) -> data page containing (a,1)
(a2,c2) -> data page but no matching tuples
(a3,f4) -> data page but no matching tuples


Query: (?,1)

?


Query: (?,?)

?
