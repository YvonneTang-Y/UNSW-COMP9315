Employees table with b = 100,  b_q2 = 3,  b_q3 = 20

Assumptions: no overflow pages, deletion by "marking"

First cost is cost of finding tuple to be deleted


q1: delete from Employees where id = 12345 

Cost = Cost_one + 1 write

Best = 1*reads + 1*writes
Worst = b*reads + 1*writes
Missing = b*reads 


q2: delete from Employees where dept = 'Marketing'

Cost = Cost_pmr + b_q2*writes

All  = b*reads + b_q2*writes


q3: delete from Employees where 40 <= age and age < 50

Cost = Cost_range + b_q3*writes

All  = b*reads + b_q3*writes
