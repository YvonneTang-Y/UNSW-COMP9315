Cost of scan ...

How many pages do we need to access?

b pages (all of them)

c = 100, r = 10000 => 100 pages => b = 100


When do we need to scan
* during sorting
* select ... where x = 5


Searching for tuples with a specific value
for a non-unique field

result set = {}
for pid in 0 .. b-1 {
	p = page(pid)
    for each tuple t in p {
      if (t.x == 42) add t to result set
    }
}
return result set

min/max reads = b
