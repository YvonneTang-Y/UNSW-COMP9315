FieldDesc is *not* a PostgreSQL data structure

But if it were ... (offset,length,type)
assume max length of tuples is 1024 in 8KB pages
=> 7 tuples per page + directory

offset = offset of field within tuple
to address up to 1024 bytes, need 10 bits
=> allow 16 bits = 2 bytes

length = number of bytes in a field
must be < 1024
to measure up to 1024 bytes, need 10 bits
=> allow 16 bits = 2 bytes

type = oid of entry in pg_type tables
=> 32-bit value = 4 bytes

so FieldDesc is likely 8 bytes (short,short,int)
